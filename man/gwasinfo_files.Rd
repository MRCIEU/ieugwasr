\description{
\code{gwasinfo_files()} returns a list of download URLs for each file (.vcf.gz, .vcf.gz.tbi, _report.html) associated with a dataset.
The URLs will expire in 2 hours.
If a dataset is missing from the results,
that means either the dataset doesn't exist or you don't have access to it.
If a dataset is in the results but some/all links are missing, that means the files are unavailable.
