\title{Perform LD clumping on SNP data}
\usage{
ld_clump(
  dat = NULL,
  clump_kb = 10000,
  clump_r2 = 0.001,
  clump_p = 0.99,
  pop = "EUR",
  opengwas_jwt = get_opengwas_jwt(),
  bfile = NULL,
  plink_bin = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Dataframe. Must have a variant name column (\code{rsid}) and pval column called \code{pval}.
If \code{id} is present then clumping will be done per unique id.}

\item{clump_kb}{Clumping kb window. Default is very strict, \code{10000}}

\item{clump_r2}{Clumping r2 threshold. Default is very strict, \code{0.001}}

\item{clump_p}{Clumping sig level for index variants. Default = \code{1} (i.e. no threshold)}

\item{pop}{Super-population to use as reference panel. Default = \code{"EUR"}.
Options are \code{"EUR"}, \code{"SAS"}, \code{"EAS"}, \code{"AFR"}, \code{"AMR"}.
\code{'legacy'} also available - which is a previously used verison of the EUR
panel with a slightly different set of markers}

\item{opengwas_jwt}{Used to authenticate protected endpoints. Login to \url{https://api.opengwas.io} to obtain a jwt. Provide the jwt string here, or store in .Renviron under the keyname OPENGWAS_JWT.#'}

\item{bfile}{If this is provided then will use the API. Default = \code{NULL}}

\item{plink_bin}{If \code{NULL} and \code{bfile} is not \code{NULL} then will detect
packaged plink binary for specific OS. Otherwise specify path to plink binary.
Default = \code{NULL}}

\description{
Uses PLINK clumping method, where SNPs in LD within a particular window will be pruned.
The SNP with the lowest p-value is retained.
}
\details{
This function interacts with the OpenGWAS API, which houses LD reference panels
for the 5 super-populations in the 1000 genomes reference panel.
It includes only bi-allelic SNPs with MAF > 0.01, so it's quite possible that
a variant you want to include in the clumping process will be absent.
If it is absent, it will be automatically excluded from the results.

You can check if your variants are present in the LD reference panel using
\code{\link[=ld_reflookup]{ld_reflookup()}}.

This function does put load on the OpenGWAS servers, which makes life more
difficult for other users. We have implemented a method and made available
the LD reference panels to perform clumping locally, see
\code{\link[=ld_clump]{ld_clump()}} and related vignettes for details.
