\title{Get LD matrix for list of SNPs}
\usage{
ld_matrix(
  variants,
  with_alleles = TRUE,
  pop = "EUR",
  opengwas_jwt = get_opengwas_jwt(),
  bfile = NULL,
  plink_bin = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variants}{List of variants (rsids)}

\item{with_alleles}{Whether to append the allele names to the SNP names. Default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{pop}{Super-population to use as reference panel. Default = \code{"EUR"}.
Options are \code{"EUR"}, \code{"SAS"}, \code{"EAS"}, \code{"AFR"}, \code{"AMR"}.
\code{'legacy'} also available - which is a previously used version of the EUR
panel with a slightly different set of markers}

\item{opengwas_jwt}{Used to authenticate protected endpoints. Login to \url{https://api.opengwas.io} to obtain a jwt. Provide the jwt string here, or store in .Renviron under the keyname OPENGWAS_JWT.}

\item{bfile}{If this is provided then will use the API. Default = \code{NULL}}

\item{plink_bin}{If \code{NULL} and bfile is not \code{NULL} then will detect packaged
plink binary for specific OS. Otherwise specify path to plink binary. Default = \code{NULL}}
}
\value{
Matrix of LD r values
}
\description{
This function takes a list of SNPs and searches for them in a specified
super-population in the 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference panel.
It then creates an LD matrix of r values (signed, and not squared).
All LD values are with respect to the major alleles in the 1000G dataset.
You can specify whether the allele names are displayed.
}
\details{
The data used for generating the LD matrix includes only bi-allelic SNPs
with MAF > 0.01, so it's quite possible that a variant you want to include
will be absent. If it is absent, it will be automatically excluded from the results.

You can check if your variants are present in the LD reference panel using
\code{\link[=ld_reflookup]{ld_reflookup()}}

This function does put load on the OpenGWAS servers, which makes life more
difficult for other users, and has been limited to analyse only up to 500
variants at a time. We have implemented a method and made available the LD
reference panels to perform the operation locally, see \code{\link[=ld_matrix]{ld_matrix()}} and
related vignettes for details.
